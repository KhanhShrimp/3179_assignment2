                The map on the right illustrates the <strong>total number of businesses</strong> recorded by state in 2023. 
                <u><strong>New South Wales</strong></u> leads significantly, boasting the highest number of businesses, closely followed by <u><strong>Victoria</strong></u>. 
                These two states remain the <strong>economic powerhouses of Australia</strong>, driving much of the country's commercial activity. 
                In contrast, the <u><strong>Northern Territory</strong></u> shows a <strong>considerably smaller concentration</strong> of businesses, making it the least attractive region for new business ventures. 
                This may reflect differences in population, infrastructure, and market opportunities between the states. 
                The distribution highlights Australia's <strong>diverse economic landscape</strong>, where opportunities are <strong>concentrated</strong> in key urban and commercial centers.

                The 2023 data on Australian industries reveals key economic trends. 
                The <strong>Construction</strong> sector leads with <strong>444,419</strong> businesses, indicating strong infrastructure development.

                In contrast, the <strong>Mining</strong> and <strong>Electricity, Gas, Water and Waste Services</strong> sectors have significantly fewer businesses, at <strong>8,473</strong> and <strong>8,582</strong>, highlighting challenges in these industries. 
                Overall, this data showcases a diverse economic landscape, with certain sectors clearly thriving while others require more focus and growth.

            Analyzing the charts, we observe a <strong>sharp increase in business entries following 2021</strong>, the height of the COVID years, with numbers returning to pre-pandemic levels in 2023. 
            This surge may be attributed to <strong>various incentives implemented in 2022</strong> to encourage entrepreneurship and stimulate economic recovery. 
            Similarly, the data reveals a <strong>significant rise in business exits in 2023</strong>, indicating ongoing challenges in the market. 
            These trends reflect the complexities of economic recovery as businesses adapt to changing conditions.
